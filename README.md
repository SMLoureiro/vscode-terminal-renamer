# Terminal Tab Auto Re-namer

VScode allows us to launch tasks using the debugger, however, tasks which intialise a terminal session get automatically named after the console tool (ie. debugpy) rather than the task name. Making it difficult to asses which task is running in which tab.

This extension watches for such events and renames the tab after the original task name.

Automatically renames the terminal with the task runner name.
